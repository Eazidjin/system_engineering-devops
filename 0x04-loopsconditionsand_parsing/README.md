In Week 6 of the ALX Foundations of Linux course, the focus is on process management and job control. I learned how to view running processes using commands like ps and top, how to manage jobs with jobs, fg, bg, and how to send signals to processes using kill. This week also covered how to understand process states, priorities, and how to manage background and foreground tasks effectively. Mastering these commands helps control system resources and troubleshoot running applications in Linux.
